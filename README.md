# Bollinger Band EMA Trading Strategy

A Pine Script v5 trading strategy that combines Bollinger Bands with Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to identify mean reversion opportunities in trending markets.

## Strategy Overview

This strategy identifies oversold conditions in uptrends and overbought conditions in downtrends by using Bollinger Bands for entry signals and EMA for trend direction confirmation.

## Trading Logic

### ðŸ“ˆ Buy Setup (Long Entry)

**Pre-conditions:**
1. Price must be below the 50 EMA (downtrend confirmation)
2. Price must be below the lower Bollinger Band (oversold condition)
3. Current candle closes above the lower Bollinger Band but remains below the middle Bollinger Band (mean reversion signal)

**Entry:** Buy at the open of the next candle after conditions are met

**Stop Loss:** 1.5 ATR below the entry price

**Take Profit:** Exit when price closes above the middle Bollinger Band

### ðŸ“‰ Sell Setup (Short Entry)

**Pre-conditions:**
1. Price must be above the 50 EMA (uptrend confirmation)
2. Price must be above the upper Bollinger Band (overbought condition)
3. Current candle closes below the upper Bollinger Band but remains above the middle Bollinger Band (mean reversion signal)

**Entry:** Sell at the open of the next candle after conditions are met

**Stop Loss:** 1.5 ATR above the entry price

**Take Profit:** Exit when price closes below the middle Bollinger Band
